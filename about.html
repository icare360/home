      <p>
        I'm autistic, isolated, disabled, and discriminated in the country I live in, so I still don't have help from local government.  
        I worked for a long time (about 35 years) in different industries, including energy, banking, and biotech, but I always wanted to start my own thing, and reshape the system we live in to help humanity, not enslave it.  
      </p>
      <p>
        To be able to survive, I need to finance my therapies, my living costs, and have a roof, while as it stands, I will be without one soon.  
        So by purchasing from me you're doing multiple good things, and if you like the design and the messages resonate with you, feel free to join my crew.
